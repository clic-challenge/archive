## Regular Paper Track
We will have a short (4 pages) regular paper track, which allows participants to share research ideas related to image compression.
In addition to the paper, we will host a poster session during which authors will be able to discuss their work in more detail.

We encourage exploratory research which shows promising results in:

* Lossy image compression
* Quantization (learning to quantize; dealing with quantization in optimization)
* Entropy minimization
* Image super-resolution for compression
* Deblurring
* Compression artifact removal
* Inpainting (and compression by inpainting)
* Generative adversarial networks
* Perceptual metrics optimization and their applications to compression

And in particular, how these topics can improve image compression.

**The deadlines for the  regular paper track are as follows**
