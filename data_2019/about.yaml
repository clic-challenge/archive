    - name: Michele Covell
      affiliation: "Google"
      bio: Michele Covell joined Google as a research scientist in 2005. Since 2015, she has worked on applications of neural networks for image and video compression, first for better parameter control on H.264 and more recently on using neural networks directly for image compression.  For the first 4 years after joining Google, Michele worked on audio and video fingerprinting, used for copyright protection by YouTube.  She received awards for this work for technical innovation and financial impact and the YT Content Id System received a Technical Emmy in 2013.  In between, she worked in various parts of Google, including Chrome Media, helping to evaluate and acquire the open-source compression codecs needed for the Chrome effort.  Before joining Google,  at HP Labs, she worked on streaming content-distribution networks for mobile.  That work was listed among the "top 40 accomplishments in HP Labs' [then] 40-year history".  She has also worked on audio and video processing at Interval Research Corporation (a private think tank) and acoustic noise control at SRI International.  She received her PhD from MIT and her bachelors from University of Michigan.
