## Regular Paper Track
We will have a short (4 pages) regular paper track, which allows participants to share research ideas related to image compression.
In addition to the paper, we will host a poster session during which authors will be able to discuss their work in more detail.

We encourage exploratory research which shows promising results in:

* Lossy image compression
* Quantization (learning to quantize; dealing with quantization in optimization)
* Entropy minimization
* Image super-resolution for compression
* Deblurring
* Compression artifact removal
* Inpainting (and compression by inpainting)
* Generative adversarial networks
* Perceptual metrics optimization and their applications to compression

And in particular, how these topics can improve image compression.

## Challenge Paper Track
The challenge task participants are asked to submit a short paper (up to  4 pages) detailing the algorithms which they submitted as part of the challenge.

## Submission Instructions
We strongly encourage authors to use the typeset their paper using the [CVPR 2018 Template](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/files/cvpr2018AuthorKit.zip).
The submission form and instruction can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVr8HcCIwOW-pJ13i7TuXFJjD0AL2C6V8fS9-0WGUhv1a3Wg/viewform).
