    <p><b>Nov 1:</b> We have been approved for the Third Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression at CVPR 2020. More information on the updated challenge and schedule will be available in the coming weeks.</p>

description: >
        Our workshop aims to gather publications which will advance the field of image and video compression using state of the art machine learning and computer vision techniques. Even with the long history of signal-processing oriented compression, taking new approaches to image processing have great potential, due to the proliferation of high-resolution cell-phone images and special hardware (e.g., GPUs and mobile AI accelerators). The potential in this area has already been demonstrated using recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and adversarial learning, many of these matching the best image-compression standards when measured on perceptual metrics. As such, we are interested in the various techniques associated with this class of methods. Broadly speaking, we would like to encourage the development of novel encoder/decoder architectures, novel ways to control information flow between the encoder and the decoder, novel optimization objectives for improved perceptual quality and learn how to quantize (or learn to quantize) better.

        The workshop is held on June 14th, in conjunction with CVPR 2020 which is virtual this year.  More information about CVPR2020 can be found at http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/

    - name: Nils Thuerey
      affiliation: "Technical University of Munich" 
      bio: "Nils Thuerey is an Associate-Professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). He focuses on deep-learning methods for physical data, with a special emphasis on fluids. Beyond latent-space simulation algorithms and learning with differentiable solvers, generative models have been a central theme of his work. Motivated by time-dependent problems from the physics area, Nils especially focuses on spatio-temporal data such as videos. Here, self-supervision in space as well as time has shown lots of promise, e.g., in form of the TecoGAN model, which can handle video super-resolution as well as unpaired video translation."

    - name: Tom Bird
      affiliation: "UCL" 
      bio: "Tom is a machine learning researcher at UCL, London. Currently working towards his PhD, he has worked on probabilistic generative modelling and variational methods. He has made a novel contribution to lossless compression by being a part of the research team that developed BB-ANS, a way to convert latent variable ML models such as VAEs into practical lossless compression systems. Before beginning his PhD, he worked in quantitative finance and Fintech, after getting his BA & Master's in Maths from the University of Cambridge."

    - name: Yochai Blau
      affiliation: "Technion" 
      bio: "Yochai recently completed his PhD thesis at the Technion, Israel, where he focused on fundamental tradeoffs in image compression and restoration. His contributions include theoretical research on the role of perceptual quality within modern image restoration and compression algorithms, as well as novel methodologies for properly evaluating their performance. As part of this research, he co-organized the PIRM workshop and challenges at ECCV 2018, which promoted perceptual-quality-aware algorithms and evaluation schemes.  Yochai is now working at Google on automated medicine through intelligent imaging."
