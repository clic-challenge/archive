      <title>Call for Papers</title>

      <description>Regular Paper Track We will have a short (4 pages) regular paper track, which allows participants to share research ideas related to image compression. In addition to the paper, we will host a poster session during which authors will be able to discuss their work in more detail.
We encourage exploratory research which shows promising results in:
 Lossy image compression Quantization (learning to quantize; dealing with quantization in optimization) Entropy minimization Image super-resolution for compression Deblurring Compression artifact removal Inpainting (and compression by inpainting) Generative adversarial networks Perceptual metrics optimization and their applications to compression  And in particular, how these topics can improve image compression.</description>

      <title>Challenge</title>
      <link>http://www.compression.cc/2019/challenge/</link>

      <description>Motivation The domain of image compression has traditionally used approaches discussed in forums such as ICASSP, ICIP and other very specialized venues like PCS, DCC, and ITU/MPEG expert groups. This workshop and challenge will be the first computer-vision event to explicitly focus on these fields. Many techniques discussed at computer-vision meetings have relevance for lossy compression. For example, super-resolution and artifact removal can be viewed as special cases of the lossy compression problem where the encoder is fixed and only the decoder is trained.</description>
