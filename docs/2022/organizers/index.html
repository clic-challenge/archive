He defended his master's and doctoral theses on signal processing and image compression at RWTH Aachen University in 2008 and 2012, respectively, working with J.-R. Ohm. <span id="moreTextJohannes" class="collapse">This was followed by a brief collaboration with J. Portilla at CSIC in Madrid, Spain, and a postdoctoral fellowship at NYU’s Center for Neural Science with E.P. Simoncelli. There, he studied the relationship between perception and image statistics, and pioneered the use of stochastic rate–distortion optimization and deep learning for end-to-end optimized image compression. He joined Google in early 2017 to continue working in this line of research. Johannes has served as a reviewer for top-tier publications in both machine learning and image processing, such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, Picture Coding Symposium and several IEEE Transactions, and has been a co-organizer of the Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) since 2018.</span> <a data-toggle="collapse" href="index.html#moreTextJohannes">(read more)</a>
