            Workshop and Challenge on Image Compression
        </p>

        <p>
        Our workshop aims to gather publications which will advance the field of image compression with and without neural networks. Even with the long history of signal-processing oriented compression, taking new approaches to image processing have great potential, due to the proliferation of high-resolution cell-phone images and special hardware (e.g., GPUs). The potential in this area has already been demonstrated using recurrent neural networks [Toderici2016, Toderici2017, Johnston2017], convolutional neural networks [Ballé2016, Ballé2017, Theis2017, Agustsson2017], and adversarial learning [Santurkar2017, Rippel2017], many of these matching the best image-compression standards when measured on perceptual metrics. As such, we are interested in the various techniques associated with this class of methods. Broadly speaking, we would like to encourage the development of novel encoder/decoder architectures, novel ways to control information flow between the encoder and the decoder, and learn how to quantize (or learn to quantize) better.
